# Account Backup

Are you tired of Robtop's stupid account save server? Kept getting those <cr>Backup Failed</cr> messages everytime you tried to backup your account data to the cloud? <cy>Well this mod does exactly what you need!</c>

This mod acts as an <cg>alternative account backup server</c> that allows you to backup your account data to a <cg>third-party server</c>.

<cy>You can host your own account backup server by checking **[GDAltWebserver](https://github.com/DumbCaveSpider/GDAltWebserver)** which is written in the <cc>Go Programming Language!</c>

### <cr>Use this backup mod as an alternative option, not as the main backup solution for your account!</c>
